# Introduction
When I was a child, I used to play the game console of whack-a-mole. The hamster would randomly run out of the hole. When the hamster came out, he would hit it with a mallet. It was a small game to test his reaction. I choose to use LEDs and buttons to simulate the game of whack-a-mole. First, the LED will light up randomly, indicating that the hamster appears. Press the corresponding button to turn off the LED. If successful, the score will increase by 1. This program can also be extended to reaction training lights, which are tools used to train athletes
